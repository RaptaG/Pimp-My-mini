## So what is "hardware modding"?

Hardware modding, or hardmodding for short, is the act of modifying an off-the-shelf commercial device, such as a console, to allow it to achieve things that were previously not possible simply by the use of software (either retail or [Homebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(video_games))).

## But what's the deal with the Wii mini?

The Wii mini (model RVL-201, hereafter referred to as "Wiini" for short), was a severely cut-down version of the original Wii, designed by Nintendo in a very cost-effective manner in order to get rid of old chip stock and get every last penny possible from the popularity of the Wii, before it was discontinued and replaced by its flawed successor, the Wii U. Specifically, the Wii mini lacks the following features compared to the original Wii (RVL-001):

- **Reset Button**: Not particularly useful for normal use as the Home pause menu had a reset option, however necessary for some homebrew tools.
- **SD Card Slot**: Used by some games such as the Super Smash Bros. Brawl and a lot of homebrew, especially older ones.
- **WiFi Connectivity**: Nintendo WiFi Connection and WiiConnect24 was discontinued shortly after the Wii mini's release, so including networking support was fairly redundant. However, [Wiimmfi](https://wiimmfi.de) and [RiiConnect24](https://rc24.xyz) can now restore most missing network features, however they do require some hardware modding for use on the wiini.
- **Ethernet Connection**: Similarly to WiFi, Nintendo also removed support for the Wii LAN Adapter for wired networking. Basic functionality for it can be restored using just software, but it isn't particularly useful since Wiimmfi and RC24 still require hardware modding.  
- **Second USB Port**: The Wii mini only had 1 USB port instead of 2, again probably as a severe cost-cutting measure, since the games that needed more than 1 port (and didn't require WiFi connectivity) were next to none.
- **GameCube Backwards Compatibility**: Similar to the Family Edition Wii (RVL-101), the Wiini does not have any hardware support for playing GameCube discs, using GameCube controllers and Memory Cards and anything else that utilises those ports.

Even then, the Wii mini still sold an acceptable amount of units, especially to young children or elderly people, due to its really low cost (MSRP of around 99 USD) and large back-catalog of offline games that could still run on it perfectly fine. Getting one currently is not really recommended, since an original Wii costs less on average and has more features out of the box. If you happen to have bought one back when it was first released though, this guide will help you get the most out of it.

## "Pimp" my mini?? What!? üòè
The name of this guide is taken from the American television series [Pimp My Ride](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pimp_My_Ride) and the title is used in a similar manner, in the sense of improving and upgrading your Wii mini console.
