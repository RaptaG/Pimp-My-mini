Pimp my mini is the complete guide to hardware modding your Nintendo Wii mini console
It contains useful tutorials and information on restoring missing functionality from the Wii mini console or expanding its abilities further, making it closer in features to the original Wii console, with a dramatically different console footprint.

For more information, see [this Wikipedia article on the Wii mini and its differences to the original  Nintendo Wii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii#Wii_Mini)
We're here to help people installing Homebrew Channel and many other mods to their consoles, allowing for doing pretty much anything with your console.
